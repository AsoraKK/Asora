## 🔧 **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **1. Environment Configuration**
Add these environment variables to your Azure Function App:

```bash
# Already configured (existing OAuth system)
COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING=AccountEndpoint=https://asora-cosmos.documents.azure.com:443/...
JWT_SECRET=your-existing-jwt-secret

# Privacy-specific configuration
PRIVACY_EXPORT_RATE_LIMIT=1                    # 1 export per 24 hours per user
PRIVACY_DELETE_RATE_LIMIT=3                    # 3 deletion attempts per 24 hours per user
AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true                         # Enable comprehensive audit logging
PRIVACY_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=2555               # 7 years for compliance (2555 days)

# Optional - Performance tuning
PRIVACY_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE=100                 # Records per batch for large exports
PRIVACY_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS=30000               # 30 second timeout for database queries
PRIVACY_MAX_EXPORT_SIZE_MB=50                # Maximum export file size in MB
```

### **2. Database Container Verification**
Ensure these Cosmos DB containers exist with proper indexing:

```bash
# Core containers (should already exist)
- users            # User profiles and account data
- posts            # User posts and content
- comments         # User comments
- votes            # User voting history

# Moderation containers (from previous implementation)
- content_flags    # User content flagging history
- appeals          # User appeal submissions
- appeal_votes     # User votes on appeals

# Additional containers that may be needed
- sessions         # User session data (if stored in Cosmos)
- user_preferences # User privacy and app preferences
- audit_logs       # Privacy operation audit trail
```

### **3. Deploy Functions**
Use your existing deployment script:

```bash
# Navigate to functions directory
cd functions/

# Build the functions
npm run build

# Deploy to Azure
npm run deploy

# Or use Azure Functions Core Tools
func azure functionapp publish asora-backend-functions --typescript
```

### **4. Verify Deployment**
Test each endpoint after deployment:

```bash
# Test export endpoint (should require valid JWT)
curl -X GET https://asora-backend-functions.azurewebsites.net/api/user/export \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TEST_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected: 200 OK with user data JSON or 401 for invalid token

# Test delete endpoint (should require confirmation header)
curl -X POST https://asora-backend-functions.azurewebsites.net/api/user/delete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TEST_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Confirm-Delete: true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected: 200 OK with deletion confirmation or 400 without confirmation header
```

## 📊 **POST-DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION**

### **Functional Testing**
- [ ] User can successfully export their data (returns comprehensive JSON)
- [ ] Export includes all user data categories (profile, posts, comments, votes, etc.)
- [ ] Rate limiting works (second export within 24h is blocked)
- [ ] Account deletion requires confirmation header
- [ ] Account deletion removes user data and anonymizes content
- [ ] Deleted user cannot authenticate (JWT tokens invalidated)
- [ ] Privacy operations are logged in audit trail

### **Security Testing**
- [ ] Users cannot export other users' data (authorization check)
- [ ] Invalid JWT tokens are rejected (401 response)
- [ ] Expired JWT tokens are rejected (401 response)  
- [ ] Missing confirmation header blocks deletion (400 response)
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse scenarios
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

### **Performance Testing**
- [ ] Export completes in <30 seconds for typical user data
- [ ] Deletion completes in <30 seconds for typical user data
- [ ] Functions handle concurrent requests without errors
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during large exports
- [ ] Database queries use proper indexing (no scans)

## 📈 **MONITORING SETUP**

### **Application Insights Queries**
Monitor your privacy service performance:

```kusto
// Monitor privacy endpoint usage
requests
| where name in ("exportUser", "deleteUser")
| summarize Count=count(), AvgDuration=avg(duration), SuccessRate=avg(success) by name
| order by Count desc

// Track privacy operation errors
exceptions
| where cloud_RoleName == "asora-backend-functions"
| where operation_Name contains "privacy" or operation_Name contains "export" or operation_Name contains "delete"
| summarize Count=count(), ErrorRate=count()*100.0/prev(count()) by type, outerMessage
| order by Count desc

// Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
traces
| where message contains "rate limit"
| summarize BlockedRequests=count() by user_Id, bin(timestamp, 1h)
| order by timestamp desc

// GDPR compliance monitoring
customEvents
| where name in ("DataExportCompleted", "AccountDeleted", "PrivacyViolation")
| summarize Count=count() by name, bin(timestamp, 1d)
| order by timestamp desc
```

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- **Privacy Request Volume**: <50 exports/day, <10 deletions/day (normal)
- **Success Rate**: >99% for both export and delete operations
- **Response Time**: <30 seconds average for privacy operations
- **Compliance Response Time**: <72 hours from request to completion
- **Error Rate**: <1% for privacy operations
- **Rate Limit Effectiveness**: >95% of abuse attempts blocked

### **Alert Thresholds**
```bash
# Set up alerts in Application Insights
# High volume alerts (potential data breach investigation)
Privacy Exports > 100/day          → Critical Alert
Account Deletions > 50/day          → High Alert

# Performance alerts  
Privacy Operation Duration > 60s     → Medium Alert
Privacy Error Rate > 5%              → High Alert
Database Query Timeout > 30s        → Medium Alert

# Security alerts
Failed Authentication > 10/hour     → High Alert
Rate Limit Violations > 50/hour     → Medium Alert
```

## 🔗 **INTEGRATION VERIFICATION**

### **Flutter Frontend Integration**
Verify the existing Flutter `PrivacyService` works with new backend:

1. **Privacy Settings Screen**: 
   - Export button triggers data download
   - Delete button shows confirmation dialog
   - Loading states display during operations
   - Error messages are user-friendly

2. **Export Flow**:
   - User taps "Export My Data"  
   - App shows loading indicator
   - Backend returns JSON data
   - App either downloads file or shows success message
   - Rate limiting prevents multiple exports

3. **Deletion Flow**:
   - User taps "Delete Account"
   - App shows confirmation dialog
   - User confirms deletion
   - App sends confirmation header
   - Backend deletes account
   - App signs user out and shows completion message

### **OAuth Integration**
- [ ] Uses existing JWT tokens from OAuth2 system
- [ ] Integrates with current user session management  
- [ ] Respects existing role-based permissions
- [ ] Works with token refresh mechanisms

---

## 🚨 **ROLLBACK PLAN**

If issues occur during deployment:

### **Immediate Rollback**
1. **Function Disable**: Disable privacy endpoints in Azure portal
2. **Route Blocking**: Block `/api/user/export` and `/api/user/delete` routes
3. **Frontend Disable**: Update Flutter app to hide privacy features
4. **User Communication**: Notify users of temporary privacy service unavailability

### **Data Safety**
1. **Export Safety**: Failed exports don't affect user data
2. **Delete Safety**: Failed deletions can be retried (idempotent)
3. **Audit Trail**: All operations logged for recovery if needed
4. **Backup Verification**: Ensure database backups are current

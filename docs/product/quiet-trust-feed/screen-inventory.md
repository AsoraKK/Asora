## Guest vs Authed Behavior Matrix

| Capability | Guest | Authenticated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read feed and post detail | Yes | Yes |
| Open receipt drawer | Yes | Yes |
| View public profile and trust passport | Yes | Yes |
| Share post externally | Yes | Yes |
| Like/comment/follow/bookmark | No | Yes |
| Create/edit/delete post | No | Yes |
| Submit appeal | No | Yes |
| Vote on appeals | No | Role-gated |

## Auth Edge Ownership

- Every blocked write action must trigger auth sheet with remembered intent.
- Returning users resume the attempted action post-auth.
- Guest experience must never dead-end without a clear path (dismiss or sign in).

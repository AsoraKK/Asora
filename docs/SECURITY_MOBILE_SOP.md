Mobile Security SOP (Prod)

Certificate Pinning
- Pin SPKI (SHA-256) for API hosts in `lib/core/security/cert_pinning.dart` under `kPinnedDomains`.
- Maintain TWO pins per host: primary and rollover.
- Extract SPKI pins (leaf cert):
  1) Export leaf certificate chain:
     - `openssl s_client -connect <host>:443 -servername <host> -showcerts < /dev/null | sed -n '/-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/,$p' > chain.pem`
  2) Extract LEAF public key (adjust index if multiple certs):
     - `awk 'BEGIN{c=0} /BEGIN CERT/{c++} c==1{print} /END CERT/{if(c==1) exit}' chain.pem > leaf.pem`
  3) Derive SPKI SHA-256 (base64):
     - `openssl x509 -in leaf.pem -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64`
  4) Add as `sha256/<base64>` to `kPinnedDomains` for the host. Repeat for rollover cert.
- Update pins prior to certificate rotation. Do NOT pin to root or intermediate.
- Rollover: keep both pins active for at least 14 days before and after rotation.

Device Integrity
- Uses `flutter_jailbreak_detection` when available; fails secure if plugin errors.
- Blocks write ops (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) when compromised; reads allowed.
- App sends `X-Device-Integrity` header on every request (secure/compromised/unknown) for server audit.

Build Obfuscation
- Build release with obfuscation and split debug info (per‑build unique symbols):
  - flutter build appbundle --release --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/symbols/android/<timestamp>
  - flutter build ios --release --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/symbols/ios/<timestamp>
- Store `build/symbols/*` artifacts securely for crash decoding.

Support Bypass Policy
- Only with an authenticated, time‑boxed support build signed with a special flavor.
- Default builds do not expose bypass toggles. Use remote kill‑switch to TEMPORARILY disable pinning if outage.

 Pin Mismatch Handling
- Expected symptoms: connection failures to pinned host; user-friendly message: "Secure connection could not be established. Please try again on a trusted network or update the app."
- Triage: verify SPKI, check if cert rotated; push hotfix with rollover pin if needed.
- Collect device reports with timestamp, OS version, and network type.

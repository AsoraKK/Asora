# Business Entity Decision Tree (Non-Legal Advice)

Last updated: 2026-02-16  
Scope: minimum corporate setup to support Lythaus (formerly Asora) launch operations.

## Decision tree

1. Primary fundraising and investor base US-centric?
   - Consider US parent structure (commonly Delaware C-Corp).
2. Primary operations and founders South Africa-based?
   - Consider South African (Pty) Ltd first, with later holding/subsidiary structure if needed.
3. Mexico is primary early operating market?
   - Consider local entity or compliant employer/contracting structure for staffing.
4. Monetization not live at GA?
   - Minimum viable setup still needs one legal entity to own store/cloud/contracts.

## Minimum viable checklist for launch

- Legal entity registered and in good standing.
- Business bank account open.
- Entity owns:
  - Apple Developer Program account
  - Google Play Console account
  - Domain registrations
  - Cloud subscriptions/accounts
- Named legal and privacy contacts are live in policy pages.
- Corporate counsel engaged for policy and contract review.
- Tax advisor engaged for cross-border VAT/sales-tax planning.

## Data and compliance ownership checklist

- Vendor register maintained (Azure, Cloudflare, Hive).
- DPA/SCC artifacts linked in compliance packet.
- Incident/legal contact list published internally.
- Store metadata organization details match legal entity records.

## Exit criteria

- Entity can sign Apple/Google agreements.
- Contact details are consistent across stores and policy pages.
- Ownership of critical assets is documented and not tied to personal accounts.

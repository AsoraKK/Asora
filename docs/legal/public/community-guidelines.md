## Our Core Principles

1. **Be Authentic** — Share real experiences and original content. Lythaus is built for human expression.
2. **Be Respectful** — Treat others with dignity, even in disagreement.
3. **Be Responsible** — Consider the impact of your words and actions on others.

## What's Not Allowed

### Harmful Content

- **Hate speech**: Content that attacks or demeans individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or other protected characteristics.
- **Harassment & bullying**: Targeted, repeated, or severe attacks against individuals — including threats, intimidation, doxxing, and coordinated harassment.
- **Violence & threats**: Content that promotes, glorifies, or threatens real-world violence.
- **Self-harm**: Content that promotes or glorifies self-harm or suicide. If you or someone you know is in crisis, please contact local emergency services.

### Deceptive Content

- **Misinformation**: Deliberately false or misleading claims that could cause real-world harm (health, safety, elections).
- **AI-generated content presented as human**: Content created by AI tools must be clearly labelled. Our automated systems detect and flag undisclosed AI content.
- **Impersonation**: Pretending to be another person, organization, or public figure.
- **Spam & manipulation**: Coordinated inauthentic behavior, engagement manipulation, or commercial spam.

### Illegal Content

- **CSAM**: Any sexualized content involving minors — zero tolerance, immediate removal and reporting.
- **Illegal activities**: Content that promotes or facilitates illegal activities.
- **Intellectual property**: Content that violates copyright or trademark rights.

### Privacy Violations

- **Personal information**: Sharing others' private information (addresses, phone numbers, financial details) without consent.
- **Non-consensual intimate content**: Sharing intimate images or videos without the subject's consent.

## How Moderation Works

### Automated Review

Every post goes through automated content analysis at submission:

- Our AI systems check content against our guidelines.
- High-confidence violations are blocked immediately.
- Borderline content is flagged for human review while remaining visible.
- **Important**: Automated decisions can be wrong. You can always appeal.

### Community Review

When you appeal a moderation decision:

1. Trusted community members review your appeal.
2. A vote determines the outcome (3-vote quorum, 5-minute window).
3. Results are based on weighted community consensus.

### Admin Review

Trust & safety staff can:

- Override any automated or community decision.
- Review escalated cases.
- Adjust moderation thresholds based on false-positive patterns.

## Appeals Process

If your content is flagged or blocked:

1. You'll see a clear explanation on your post (including whether the decision was automated).
2. Tap **"Appeal this decision"** to submit your case.
3. Provide context — explain why you believe the decision was incorrect.
4. Community members and/or admins will review your appeal.
5. You'll be notified of the outcome.

**False positive?** If you believe AI moderation incorrectly flagged your content, select "False positive" as the appeal type — these are prioritized for faster review.

## Consequences

| Violation Level | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| First minor violation | Content flagged with warning |
| Repeated minor violations | Content blocked, warning issued |
| Serious violation | Content removed, temporary suspension |
| Severe or repeated serious violations | Account permanently disabled |
| Criminal content (CSAM, credible threats) | Immediate removal + law enforcement referral |

## Reporting

To report content that violates these guidelines:

1. Tap the **⋮** menu on any post.
2. Select **"Report"**.
3. Choose the reason for your report.
4. Your report is anonymous — content authors won't know who reported.

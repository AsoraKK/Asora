# Lythaus Migration (Asora -> Lythaus)

Purpose: keep naming consistent during the beta transition.

## Domains
- `asora.co.za`: platform base (API, control panel, Azure Functions).
- `lythaus.co`: marketing site and waitlist.

## Do
- Use "Lythaus" for app UI, store listings, and marketing copy.
- Use "Lythaus (formerly Asora)" when introducing the product in docs.
- Keep "Asora" for internal/infra names (repo, Azure resources, Terraform, package IDs).

## Don't
- Rename Azure resources, package identifiers, or internal imports.
- Use "Asora" in user-facing copy.

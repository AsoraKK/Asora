    <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to Lythaus — a platform built on authenticity, respect, and human
      connection. These guidelines help keep our community a safe and meaningful
      space for everyone.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Core Principles</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Be Authentic</strong> — Share real experiences and original content.</li>
      <li><strong>Be Respectful</strong> — Treat others with dignity, even in disagreement.</li>
      <li><strong>Be Responsible</strong> — Consider the impact of your words on others.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What's Not Allowed</h2>

    <h3>Harmful Content</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hate speech</strong>: Attacks based on protected characteristics.</li>
      <li><strong>Harassment &amp; bullying</strong>: Targeted attacks, threats, doxxing.</li>
      <li><strong>Violence &amp; threats</strong>: Content promoting real-world violence.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-harm</strong>: Content promoting or glorifying self-harm or suicide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deceptive Content</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Misinformation</strong>: Deliberately false claims causing real-world harm.</li>
      <li><strong>AI-generated content</strong>: Must be clearly labelled. Our systems detect undisclosed AI content.</li>
      <li><strong>Impersonation</strong>: Pretending to be another person or organization.</li>
      <li><strong>Spam</strong>: Coordinated inauthentic behavior or engagement manipulation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Illegal Content</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>CSAM — zero tolerance.</li>
      <li>Content promoting illegal activities.</li>
      <li>Copyright or trademark violations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Moderation Works</h2>
    <p>
      Every post goes through automated content analysis. High-confidence violations
      are blocked immediately. Borderline content is flagged for human review while
      remaining visible. <strong>Automated decisions can be wrong — you can always appeal.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Appeals</h2>
    <p>
      If your content is flagged or blocked, you'll see a clear explanation.
      Tap <strong>"Appeal this decision"</strong> to submit your case. Community members
      and/or admins will review your appeal, and you'll be notified of the outcome.
    </p>

    <h2>Consequences</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First minor violation: content flagged with warning.</li>
      <li>Repeated violations: content blocked, warning issued.</li>
      <li>Serious violations: content removed, temporary suspension.</li>
      <li>Severe violations: permanent account disable.</li>
      <li>Criminal content: immediate removal + law enforcement referral.</li>
    </ul>

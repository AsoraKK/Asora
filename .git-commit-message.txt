fix(deploy): Preserve functionAppConfig.deployment.storage in PATCH

Root cause: PATCH was clobbering functionAppConfig and dropping deployment.storage,
causing ARM /publish to have nowhere to bind the package (404 on all endpoints).

Changes:
- PATCH already merges via jq (preserves deployment.storage and other fields)
- Added: Grant Function App MI Storage Blob Data Reader on storage account
- Added: Restart step after /publish to force host reload
- Removed: Azure Functions Action (back to storage upload + ARM /publish)
- Keep: No Kudu path (avoids HNS/blob name issues)

RBAC required:
- GitHub OIDC app: Storage Blob Data Contributor (for upload)
- Function App MI: Storage Blob Data Reader (to fetch package)

Fixes HTTP 404 on health endpoint by ensuring deployment.storage is preserved
and Function App can access the deployment blob.

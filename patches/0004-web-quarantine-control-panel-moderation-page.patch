# Patch: 0004-web-quarantine-control-panel-moderation-page.patch
# What:
# - Moves orphan Control Panel page `src/pages/Moderation.jsx` to graveyard quarantine.
# Why (evidence):
# - No app route/import references use this file.
# - `/moderation` currently maps to `Flags` page in `src/App.jsx`.
# - Quarantine used (not delete) because Control Panel baseline tests currently include one failing test unrelated to this file.
# Validation commands:
# - npm --prefix apps/control-panel run build
# - npm --prefix apps/control-panel run test
# Rollback:
# - git apply -R patches/0004-web-quarantine-control-panel-moderation-page.patch

# Patch: 0001-dart-quarantine-unused-utils-and-mocks.patch
# What:
# - Moves unused Dart utility and mock files to graveyard quarantine.
# - Adds graveyard quarantine README for 2026-02-22 batch.
# Why (evidence):
# - `rg` shows no runtime/test imports for moved files.
# - Duplicate replacements exist in active paths under `lib/features/...`.
# - Full baseline test pass is not currently provable (Flutter suite instability), so quarantine is used.
# Validation commands:
# - flutter analyze
# - flutter test --coverage
# - bash scripts/check_coverage_gates.sh
# Rollback:
# - git apply -R patches/0001-dart-quarantine-unused-utils-and-mocks.patch

+# Graveyard Quarantine - 2026-02-22
+
+This folder contains code quarantined by a safe-mode unused-code pass.
+
+Why quarantined:
+- Static scans indicate no active references.
+- Baseline full-suite verification is not fully green in this environment.
+- To reduce risk, files are moved instead of deleted.
+
+Signals to monitor after patch apply:
+- Missing imports or runtime class resolution errors.
+- UI regressions in feed/moderation/privacy flows.
+- CI failures in Flutter tests or coverage gates.
+
+Deletion criteria after quarantine:
+- One full release cycle passes with no regressions.
+- Full build/test/coverage checks pass in CI after quarantine.
+- No reintroduction of references to quarantined paths.
+
+Rollback:
+- `git apply -R patches/0001-dart-quarantine-unused-utils-and-mocks.patch`
+  (or restore specific files from this directory to original paths).

# Patch: 0002-dart-quarantine-legacy-appeal-pages.patch
# What:
# - Moves two legacy appeal page wrappers to graveyard quarantine.
# Why (evidence):
# - No imports/references found in `lib/` or `test/`; only historical migration docs mention these paths.
# - Both files are duplicate wrappers to the same feature screen.
# Validation commands:
# - flutter analyze
# - flutter test --coverage
# - bash scripts/check_coverage_gates.sh
# Rollback:
# - git apply -R patches/0002-dart-quarantine-legacy-appeal-pages.patch

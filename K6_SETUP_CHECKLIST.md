# k6 Canary SLO Gate - Setup Checklist

## âœ… Implementation Status

### Pre-Deployment Gating (Production Path)
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/deploy-asora-function-dev.yml`
- **Flow**: `canary-k6` job runs smoke + feed tests â†’ gates `deploy` job
- **Gate Mechanism**: `deploy` has `needs: [canary-k6]` (fails deploy if canary fails)
- **k6 Thresholds**: 
  - Smoke: p95<5000ms, p99<10000ms (cold-start safe)
  - Feed: p95<3000ms, p99<5000ms (warm endpoint safe)
- **Override via env vars**: `SMOKE_P95_THRESHOLD`, `FEED_READ_P95_THRESHOLD`, etc.

### Post-Deployment Verification (Observability Path)
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/canary-k6.yml`
- **Trigger**: `workflow_run` (after deploy completes) + `workflow_call` (reusable)
- **Purpose**: Independent verification + PR comments

### Both Workflows Use
- âœ… `grafana/setup-k6-action@v1` (reliable k6 install)
- âœ… Standardized `K6_BASE_URL` env var
- âœ… Scenario-tagged thresholds
- âœ… `if: always()` for artifact upload on failure
- âœ… `.txt` + `.json` summaries

## ðŸ”§ Required Repo Configuration

### Repository Variables (Settings > Secrets and Variables > Variables)
- [ ] `K6_BASE_URL`: Set to your Function App URL
  - Example: `https://asora-function-dev.azurewebsites.net`
  - Used in `canary-k6.yml` as fallback

### Repository Secrets (Settings > Secrets and Variables > Secrets)
- [ ] `K6_SMOKE_TOKEN`: Optional bearer token if API needs auth
  - Leave empty if no authentication required
  - Used in `canary-k6.yml` if set

## âœ… Verification Steps

1. **Push to main** â†’ GitHub Actions triggers `deploy-asora-function-dev.yml`
2. **canary-k6 job runs first** (smoke + feed tests)
3. **If thresholds breached** â†’ job fails with exit code 99 â†’ deploy blocked
4. **If thresholds pass** â†’ deploy job runs
5. **Artifacts uploaded** â†’ view k6 summaries in Actions tab
6. **Post-deploy verification** â†’ `canary-k6.yml` runs via `workflow_run`

## ðŸ“Š Threshold Strategy

### Current Defaults (Production)
- **Smoke**: p95<5s, p99<10s (accounts for cold-start)
- **Feed**: p95<3s, p99<5s (realistic for warm endpoints)

### Tighten for Post-Warm Performance
Set environment variables in workflow:
```yaml
env:
  SMOKE_P95_THRESHOLD: 500      # 500ms for warm smoke
  SMOKE_P99_THRESHOLD: 1000     # 1s for warm smoke
  FEED_READ_P95_THRESHOLD: 300  # 300ms for warm feed
  FEED_READ_P99_THRESHOLD: 600  # 600ms for warm feed
```

### Original Spec (Not Recommended for Serverless)
- p95<200ms, p99<400ms requires always-warm infrastructure
- Would fail all cold-start deployments
- Consider warm-up phase if strict compliance required

## ðŸ“‹ Minimal Acceptance Checklist

- âœ… k6 scripts exist: `load/k6/smoke.js`, `load/k6/feed-read.js`
- âœ… Pre-deploy gating: `deploy-asora-function-dev.yml` has `canary-k6` job
- âœ… Deploy blocked on failure: `deploy` has `needs: [canary-k6]`
- âœ… Thresholds enforced: k6 exits 99 on breach â†’ job fails
- âœ… Artifacts uploaded: Even on test failure (`if: always()`)
- âœ… Post-deploy verification: `canary-k6.yml` runs independently
- âœ… PR comments: Show k6 results in PRs (when run)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Set `K6_BASE_URL` repo variable (required)
2. Push to main â†’ verify canary job runs before deploy
3. Monitor first few deployments for threshold compliance
4. Adjust thresholds if needed via env vars or code updates
